# HorribleAI
First python project: A horrible recreation of Iron Man's Jarvis alarm clock featured in the movie.

This was my first python project from the summer of 2014. I have edited a few files removing commented out code and just added a small description comment at the top of the files.

The discontinuation of this project led to some API keys to expire. The original TTS engine was Google Translate which was later closed then I used tts-api and that didn't work out so I finally resorted to a built-in linux tts engine called espeak which is very bad quality, but does the job. This is a very small project which can be better modified. Since this was my first python project, I was not aware of python conventions or better code structures so I used functions and just called the python script from a bash script one file at a time. Also as a naive programmer, I violated Yahoo Finance's terms of use and scraped their raw http requests. If I were to continue this project, I would implement OOP and use classes, use Google's speech api, make news headlines more concise, and use a legal stock price parsing API.
